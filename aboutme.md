I am Anandi Tamby, a marine microbiologist. I am passionate about nature and the environment. I'll use this blog to bridge science and political issues. 

What else do you need?

### My story

I grew in the French Alps, and always had a kinship with animals and nature. After graduating highschool, studying biology was an obvious choice. I had the opportunity to live for one year in Hong Kong and to pursue my master in Marine Sciences in the Netherlands. Throughout my studies, I realized how intertwined public health, environmental science and medicine are intertwined. With this blog, I aim to analyze political and philosophical issues with the eye of an environmental scientist!
